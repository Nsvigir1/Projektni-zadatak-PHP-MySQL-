            Computer programming is the process of designing and building an
            executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or
            to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as:
            analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms accuracy and
            resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen
            programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code
            of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible
            to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by
            the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a
            sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task
            (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often
            for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires
            expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the
            application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing,
            debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and
            management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer
            programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but
            often the term software development is used for this larger process with
            the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual
            writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques
            with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related
            process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and
            re-create/re-implement.
